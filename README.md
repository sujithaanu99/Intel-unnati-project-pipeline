# Intel Unnati Project – AI & Machine Learning

This repository contains a project developed as part of the **Intel Unnati Industrial Training Program**.

## Project Title
Scalable Object Detection and Classification Pipeline using OpenVINO and DL Streamer

## Description
A real-time multi-stream video analytics pipeline built using Intel OpenVINO and DL Streamer.
The system performs:
- Person and vehicle detection
- Attribute classification (age, gender, vehicle type, color)
- Performance analysis using FPS and latency metrics

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenVINO Toolkit
- DL Streamer
- GStreamer
- OpenCV

## Team Information
This was a **team-based project** carried out during the Intel Unnati Program.

## My Contribution
- Worked on understanding the project pipeline
- Assisted in integration of detection and classification models
- Tested multi-stream execution and evaluated performance
- Contributed to project documentation and reporting
